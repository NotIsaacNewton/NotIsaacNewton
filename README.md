On this profile you will find four pinned repositories: 

_propagate_ does 1D FFT wavepacket propogation using split-operators. It uses ArmPL for the fftw methods.

_Romberg-Quadratures_ is a numerical integration program that makes use of Romberg quadratures, otherwise known as Romberg's method.

_vpythonplus_ is my attempt at streamlining vpython's functionality, because I got tired of writing the same code each time I made a small simulation. I am no longer working on this project, and anyone who wants to make use of the code is welcome to do whatever they want with it.

_cphysics_ is a small C++ physics engine that was originally based on vpythonplus. Though it works, I consider it incomplete, as I still plan to add collission detection, an implicit euler or implicit verlet method, and RK4 and RKF method. There is also no way to actually see what is going on, so I am building a renderer based on OpenGL. My current goal is in rewriting the whole project to make adding changes, optimizations, and new methods a little easier.
