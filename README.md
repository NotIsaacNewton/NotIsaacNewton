On this profile you will find three pinned repositories: 

Romberg-Quadratures is a numerical integration program that makes use of Romberg quadratures, otherwise known as Romberg's method.

vpythonplus is my attempt at streamlining vpython's functionality, because I got tired of writing the same code each time I made a small simulation. I am currently working on adding an RKF solver to this project.

cphysics is a small C++ physics engine that was originally based on vpythonplus. Though it works, I consider it incomplete, as I still plan to add collission detection, an implicit euler or implicit verlet method, and an RKF method. There is also no way to actually see what is going on, so I need to add some kind of renderer.
